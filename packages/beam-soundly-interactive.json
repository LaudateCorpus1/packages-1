Beam Soundly Interactive\nis built with node.js and electron! Checkout the package.json file for dependencies!\n\nThe Interactive App on Beam has yet to be published and I am looking for suggestions\non different states I should have to allow for different global cooldowns and spark costs.\n\n## Screenshots\n![Beam Soundly Interactive](http://i.imgur.com/pLPzVeB.png)\n\n## License\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Derek Jensen\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
