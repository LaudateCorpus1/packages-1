  "readme": "# bozon \n> Scaffold, Run, Test and Package [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application with ease\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/bozon.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/bozon) \n![img](https://circleci.com/gh/railsware/bozon.svg?style=shield&circle-token=73a7ce20fc55a51d77657e11c3f5c9d4bf5fdcd9)\n\n## What is Bozon?\nBozon is a single tool for handling different tasks being performed by multiple packages, which is used for building desktop applications with Electron. Simplify building, compiling, running, testing, and packaging your application.\n\n* **Electron** - build cross platform desktop apps with web technologies\n* **Gulp** - task runner that helps making all important processes with a single command\n* **Webpack** - building and packaging source code for renderer process done with webpack\n* **spectron** - Easily test your Electron apps using ChromeDriver and WebdriverIO\n* **electron-builder** - package and distribute your Electron app\n\n![img](https://api.monosnap.com/rpc/file/download?id=KB5BGmknhLmuE38DGEXCFu4rbpBUzr)\n\n## Installation\n\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g bozon\n```\n\nThen generate your new project:\n\n```bash\nbozon new [name]\n```\nThis will create a new directory `[name]` produce the following file structure:\n\n```\n  |--app/\n  |  |--images/\n  |  |--javascripts/\n  |  |  |--renderer/\n  |  |  |--main/\n  |  |--stylesheets/\n  |  |--index.html\n  |  |--package.json\n  |--config/\n  |--spec/\n  |--gulpfile.js\n  |--package.json\n```\n\n## Starting an application\n\n```bash\nbozon start\n```\n\nThis will compile Application source code to `./builds/development` directory and run your application from it.\n\n### Configuration\nBozon provides a way to define environment specific and platform specific configuration options. These multiple config files are being merged into one single `settings` object during build. This `settings` object is being written into `package.json` file of your application, so that you can use it in your code.\n```\n  |--config/\n  |  |--settings.json\n  |  |--environments/\n  |  |  |--development.json\n  |  |  |--production.json\n  |  |  |--test.json\n  |  |--platforms/\n  |  |  |--osx.json\n  |  |  |--linux.json\n  |  |  |--windows.json\n```\n\n## Testing\nBozon is using [spectron](https://github.com/electron/spectron) and [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) spec runner for testing Electron applications. Both unit and integration tests should go to `./specs` directory. Simply execute for running tests:\n\n```bash\nbozon test\n```\n\n## Packaging application\nPackaging Electron application is done by [electron-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder) using settings in defined in `package.json` under `build` section.\nApplication source code is being compiled to `./builds/production/` directory, and packaged versions for different platforms go to `./packages` directory.\n\n```bash\nbozon package [osx|windows|linux]\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© Alex Chaplinsky\n"
