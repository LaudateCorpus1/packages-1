  "readme": "# BrightAuthor Next Generation (BANG)\n## BrightAuthorNG Data Model\n\nThis project contains the data model for BrightAuthor projects implemented on top of Redux.\n\n#### General dependencies\n* Node.js 6.x (supports ES6)\n    * We have minor dependencies so far in code, otherwise this is used for compiling, running tests, etc.\n* Redux, Reselect\n* Typescript\n* Typings (Typescript definition manager for libraries)\n* TsUnit for simple unit testing\n\n#### About Typescript\n* This project is currently using version 2.0 of Typescript, which was released on Sept. 6, 2016. The latest version of Webstorm still bundles version 1.8 - see setup instructions below to point Webstorm at the newer compiler.\n    * I am using the new _readonly_ keyword which requires version 2.0.\n\n### General Development Prep\n* If you get errors when using 'npm install' or 'npm link', see <https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions>\n* You still might have to use sudo to install global packages\n* Install node.js (Latest version recommended - currently 6.6.0. Electron uses 6.3.0 as of last check.)\n* Install the 'typings' package:\n    > npm install -g typings\n* Typescript: the stand-alone version must be installed and used. If you have already installed it, install again to get version 2.0.\n    > npm install - g typescript\n    \n### Project Prep\n* Before doing anything to prepare this project, make sure that the directory you have opened in WebStorm is the baDataModel directory - not the base directory of the repo, which is the master directory for other related projects.\n    * The baDataModel directory will then become the \"content root\" of the WebStorm project - all additional paths are calculated relative to that.\n* Install node_modules (this will create or update node-modules directory)\n    > npm install\n* Link globally installed Typescript compiler for current project\n    > npm link typescript\n* Retrieve library typings (this will create or update typings directory)\n    > typings install\n* Extra prepare step to compile the Typescript tsUnit files\n    > npm run prepare\n\n### WebStorm Setup\n* Open WebStorm Preferences\n    * On page: Directories\n        * Make sure the top line in the Directory list - the \"content root\" -  is \\<repo_base\\>/baDataModel. If it isn't, you probably started in the wrong directory.\n    * On page: Languages and Frameworks, select Javascript\n        * Select ECMAScript 6 as Javascript language version\n    * On page: Languages and Frameworks, expand Javascript node, select Libraries\n        * The Redux library is installed by npm, and the typings file should have loaded the library declarations already\n        * You should see redux-DefinitelyTyped in the Libraries list - enable it.\n        * The library for ECMAScript 6 should also bechecked.\n    * On page: Languages and Frameworks, select TypeScript\n        * If the Typescript version is less than 2.0, you need to point to version 2 of the compiler that you have installed globally.\n            * Click the edit button next to Typescript version\n            * Browse to the directory containing the typescriptServices.js files. On macOS, this is probably _/usr/local/lib/node_modules/typescript/lib_.\n            * Set this as the custom directory and click ok.\n        * Make sure \"Enable TypeScript Compiler\" and \"Track Changes\" is  checked (this enables the watcher for immediate transpilation.)\n        * Make sure \"Resolve objects using tsconfig.json is checked.\n\n* Testing\n    * Testing is based on the tsUnit package - see https://github.com/Steve-Fenton/tsUnit\n        * The advantage of tsUnit is that it is Typescript, it is simple, and it can be easily debugged and traced.\n    * I am currently directly running my various test files, all located in the 'tests' directory, directly from the terminal window.\n        * For example, to run the Sign Tests, type:\n            > node temp/tests/baDmSignTests.js\n        * We are running out of the temp directory because that is where the transpiled javascript is\n    * Current configuration of this is very rudimentary. This will get more formalized, but it works fine for development. Eventually we will have a single master test suite entry file.\n        \n* Set up debug configuration\n    * You can debug with the tests as well, placing breakpoints in the Typescript code.\n    * From Run menu, select \"Edit Configurations...\"\n    * Click on the '+' at upper left to add a debug configuration.\n    * Select Node.js as configuration type. Node.js Debug details page will open.\n    * Type a friendly name into the Name box (e.g., 'BaDm Test')\n    * In the working directory field, select the full path on your machine to the ../BANextGen/baDataModel/temp/tests\n    * In the Javascript file field, type the name of the file you want to debug.\n    * Click OK.\n\n* Build and Test\n    * No separate build step is necessary currently - the WebStorm Typescript watcher handles it.\n    * Run test file directly from terminal window as described above (or add scripts to package.json and run with npm.)\n    * Start debugging by clicking on green bug icon at top right of WebStorm menu.\n\n"
