  "readme": "# electron-largetype\n\nLarge Type for Electron apps\n\n![screenshot](screenshot.png)\n\n## Getting the library\n\n    $ npm install electron-largetype\n\n## Using it\n\nSomewhere in your Electron app you can do this:\n```javascript\nvar largetype = require(\"electron-largetype\")\n\nlargetype.show(\"This text is large!\")\n```\n\nEasy as that.\n\n## About Large Type\n\nOriginally built-in to certain OS X apps, \"Show Text in Large Type\" was popularized by Quicksilver as a way to quickly display text in easy to read large letters on your screen, typically to be read at a distance. Although it was picked up by Quicksilver alternatives like Alfred, as Spotlight became faster and more useful, there was less of a need to run fancy app launchers. As such, we lost easy Large Type.\n\nIn building DeskBot, an API to your desktop, I figured Large Type would be a great feature to include. Being an Electron app, it would just be a matter of loading a transparent browser window and implementing Large Type in HTML/CSS. I decided to make it a library so others could include Large Type in their Electron apps as well.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
