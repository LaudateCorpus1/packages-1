  "readme": "# screenshot-pool\n\n\nA high performance, rock solid and lightweight screenshot tool using a [pool](https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool) of [electrons](https://github.com/electron/electron).   \n[![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/asafyish/screenshot-pool.svg)](https://david-dm.org/asafyish/screenshot-pool)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asafyish/screenshot-pool.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asafyish/screenshot-pool)\n\n\n## About\n\nTaking screenshots using electron\nis not reliable enough. electron can crash or stop responding all together, especially if running\nunder [xvfb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb).\n\nTaking a single screenshot each time is not efficient (not utilizing multi-core).   \n\nThis tool solves both problems by providing a pool of electron workers,\nready to take screenshots as needed and scale to multi-core if requested.\n\n## How to install\n\n```bash\nnpm install screenshot-pool\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n## Taking screenshots\n\nCreate a single ScreenshotPool object, use it to capture images.\n\n```javascript\nconst MAX_POOL_SIZE = require('os').cpus().length * 2;\n\nconst ScreenshotPool = require('screenshot-pool');\nconst sp = new ScreenshotPool({\n  min: 0, // Minimum number of workers in pool. 0 is recommended\n  max: MAX_POOL_SIZE, // Maximum number of workers in pool. cpu count * 2 is recommended\n  defaultTimeout: 1000, // How long to wait before rejecting the operation\n  maxErrors: 3, // How many consecutive errors before marking the worker as bad\n  log: false // Should the pool print logs\n});\n\nsp\n  .capture({\n    url: 'data:text/html;charset=utf-8,' + htmlData, // Can also be a url\n    width: 200,\n    height: 80,\n    timeout: 1000 // Optional. defaultTimeout will be used if not provided\n  })\n  .then(imageData => {\n    // imageData is an array containing the image\n  });\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Asaf Yishai\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
