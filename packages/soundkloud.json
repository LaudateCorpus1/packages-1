  "readme": "SoundKloud\n==========\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rhysd/SoundKloud.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rhysd/SoundKloud)\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/soundkloud.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/soundkloud)\n\nSoundKloud is a [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) browser integrated with menu bar.\n\n![overall screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/screenshots/master/SoundKloud/overall.png)\n\nSoundCloud is an awesome web service I often use.  However, it provides only website in OS X.  I don't want to find a browser in my desktop and then find the SoundCloud tab in my browser only for skipping, stopping and playing the music.  So I created this app.\nYou can access to the browser at any time via your Desktop menubar.\n\nSoundKloud is cross-platform application (on [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)).  You can use SoundKloud on OS X, Linux and Windows.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Release\n\nInstall SoundKloud from [Release Page](https://github.com/rhysd/SoundKloud/releases), unzip it. It is already ready to use.\n\n- __OS X:__ Simply use `SoundKloud.app` in the directory.  If you want to install it to your system, move it to `~/Applications`.\n- __Linux:__ Simply use `soundkloud` executable in the directory.  If you want to install it to your system, set symbolic link to the executable from `/usr/local/bin`.\n- __Windows:__ Simply use `soundkloud.exe` in the directory.  No need to install.\n\n__Note:__ Windows package is removed temporarily because window location is not correct.\n\n### npm\n\n```sh\n$ npm install -g soundkloud\n$ soundkloud\n$ soundkloud --detach # Detach the process\n```\n\n### Manually\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/rhysd/SoundKloud.git && cd SoundKloud\n$ npm install -g tsc tsd\n$ gem install slim\n$ npm install\n$ rake run\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter starting SoundKloud, you can find SoundCloud icon in menubar of your desktop.\n\n![menubar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/screenshots/master/SoundKloud/menubar.png)\n\nSoundKloud is integrated with menu.  So you can access the SoundCloud browser as if item of the menu.  Just click it!\n\nAt first time, you need to sign in to the page.  Please click \"Sign in\" in the page.  After that, you need not to login anymore.\n\nIf you want to quit this app, please use key shortcut `Control+Q` (`Command+Q` for OS X).\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can customize SoundKloud with `{app dir}/config.yml` file.\n`{app dir}` is:\n\nOS      | Location\n------- | ------------------------------------------\nLinux   | `~/.config/SoundKloud`\nOS X    | `~/Library/Application Support/SoundKloud`\nWindows | Sorry, I don't know\n\n### `icon_type`\n\nYou can specify the color of icon in menu bar.  The possible values are `gradient`, `grey` and `white`.  Default value is `gradient`.\n\n### `hot_key`\n\nYou can open SoundKloud without away from keyboard using hot key.  Please be careful to choose the hot key because this is a global shortcut.  Default value is `mod+shift+s`.  If you want to disable hot key, please specify empty string.\n\n### `flash_plugin`\n\nValue for the `flash_plugin` is an object which has 3 keys `enabled`, `plugin_path` and `plugin_version`.\nIn some environment, some tracks on SoundCloud may require evil Flash player.  If you want to enable it,\n\n- set `enabled` to `true`,\n- set path to your flash player which Chrome uses to `plugin_path`. (The name of flash player binary is \"libpepflashplayer.so\" for Linux, \"PepperFlashPlayer.plugin\" for OS X, \"pepflashplayer.dll\" for Windows)\n- set version of your flash player.  You can check it in `chrome://plugins` tab of your Chrome.\n\n### `shortcuts`\n\nYou can define shortcuts in SoundKloud.  This is an object of key input and action.  Available actions are `QuitApp`, `NextTrack`, `PreviousTrack`, `PlayStop`, `Shuffle`, `Reload`, `GoBack`, `GoForward`, `ScrollDown`, `ScrollUp`, `ScrollTop`, `ScrollBottom`, `Cut`, `Copy`, `Paste`, `selectAll`, `Undo`, `Redo` and `Open`.  SoundKloud uses [mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice), so the format of the keyshortcut is the same as it.  Please refer the document of mousetrap.  If you set SoundCloud URL string as an action, the shortcut make the window jump to specified URL.\nOf course, you can use `soundcloud.com` website's key shortcuts (`j` for next track, `k` for previous track, and so on).\n\n### `start_page`\n\nYou can specify the page shown at start up of this app.  Default value is `https://soundcloud.com`\n\n### `auto_start`\n\nYou can start SoundKloud automatically at OS starting when this value is `true`.  Default value is `false`.\n\n### `preload_js`, `preload_css`\n\nSet the JavaScript file name and CSS file name which are loaded on the SoundCloud page.  They must be put in the application directory.\n\n### Default Config\n\n```yaml\nicon_type: \"gradient\"\nhot_key: \"mod+shift+s\"\nflash_plugin:\n  enabled: false\n  plugin_path: \"\"\n  plugin_version: \"\"\nstart_page: \"https://soundcloud.com\"\nauto_start: false\nshortcuts:\n  mod+q: \"QuitApp\"\n  mod+r: \"Reload\"\n  mod+x: \"Cut\"\n  mod+c: \"Copy\"\n  mod+v: \"Paste\"\n  mod+p: \"ScrollUp\"\n  mod+n: \"ScrollDown\"\n  mod+s: \"PlayStop\"\n  mod+o: \"Open\"\nstart_page: \"https://soundcloud.com\"\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nNothing! :tada:\n\n## License\n\n    Copyright (c) 2015 rhysd\n\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\n    of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\n    subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n    copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\n    INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n    PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
