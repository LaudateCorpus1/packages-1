  "readme": "# Build Electron apps without the bloat\n\nWebpack plugin to build Electron apps. It's particularly useful to package Electron Apps which only contain required modules and assets.\n\n## Features\n\n- Brings [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) to your Webpack dev flow.\n- Supports Webpack `externals`.\n\n## Usage\n\n[Documentation: Using loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-plugins.html)\n\n```\nnpm install webpack-electron-packager -D\n```\n\nAnd then, in your webpack config:\n\n```javascript\nconst ElectronPackager = require(\"webpack-electron-packager\");\nmodule.exports = {\n    plugins: [\n        new ElectronPackager({\n          dir: \"/path/to/app\",\n          arch: \"x64\",\n          platform: \"linux\",\n        })\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Options\n\nPlugin accepts all [options in electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md#options). They can be passed in either CamelCase (e.g.: `buildVersion`) or with hyphens (e.g.: `build-version`).\n\nPlugin also adds the following:\n\n### externals\n\nSometimes, you may need to have libraries as externals. If that's the case, pass the name of the module or an array of modules as `externals`.\n\n```javascript\nconst ElectronPackager = require(\"webpack-electron-packager\");\nmodule.exports = {\n    plugins: [\n        new ElectronPackager({\n          ...\n          externals: \"my-npm-package\"\n        })\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Tests\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n"
