  "readme": "# Molecule\n\nMolecule is a tiny framework for composing systems (called \"Atoms\") into process groups (configured as \"Recipes\" and run as \"Molecules\") that comunicate with each other by passing messages (\"Electrons\") from system to system through a specific interface of handlers (\"Nuclei\") and emitters (\"Electrons\").\n\n## Readiness\n\nMolecule is still in early development. Even this documentation is fresh, and needs to be iterated over.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\n * Flexibility First, Fallbacks Second - Everything about Molecule is driven by its configuration. Where I thought it\n sensical, I've provided fallback values, even as far as the configuration itself is concerned, using\n [rc](https://npmjs.org/package/rc) and [localrc](https://npmjs.org/package/localrc) to load as much of an obvious\n configuration as possible. That said, nothing is done for you that cannot be replaced obviously and with the right\n configuration.\n * Barefoot Programming - Even a concept as core to making Molecule useful as the Control Atom uses all the same methods\n that Molecule users are expected to use. Some people call it \"eating your own dogfood\".\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 Michael Schoonmaker (michael.r.schoonmaker@gmail.com)\n\nThis project is free software released under the MIT/X11 license:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
