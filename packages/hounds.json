  "readme": "#hounds\n\n*Release the hounds* and smoke test any site. Sanity check after a large refactor, or plug into your CI tool of choice.<br />\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/TVCqfX7rLyMuY/giphy.gif)\n\nThe beasts will follow all links (internal or otherwise) and round up any uncaught page errors. As a seamless unit, they will scour the field for their quarry by spanning out, containing an area, and expanding (breadth-first search). \n\nUses [nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) to fire up an Electron webkit browser (with optional UI).\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/hounds.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/hounds)\n[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/justinjmoses%2Fhounds.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/justinjmoses%2Fhounds) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/justinjmoses/hounds.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/justinjmoses/hounds)\n\n##Usage\n\n`npm i hounds`\n\n```javascript\nconst hounds = require('hounds')\nconst hunt = hounds.release({ url: 'http://localhost:8080' })\n    .on('error', console.error)\n    .on('end', process.exit)\n\nconst quarry = new Writable({\n    objectMode: true,\n    write: (chunk, enc, next) => {\n        console.dir(chunk)\n        next()\n    }\n})\n\nhunt.pipe(quarry)\n```\n\nTo show the Electron UI, with devTools open, and keep both alive, use the following settings:\n\n```javascript\nconst hunt = hounds.release({\n    url: '...',\n    keepAlive: true,\n    nightmare: {\n        show: true, openDevTools: true\n    }\n}).on('error', console.error)\n```\n\n##Options\n* `url` base URL to start from\n* `keepAlive` don't end the stream or the nightmare session when complete (when combined with `nightmare.show`, allows you to interact with the browser when done).\n* `waitAfterLoadedFor` The number of milliseconds to wait after each page is loaded before following the next link in the queue\n* `maxFollows` The maximum number of links to follow and track (the default is `Infinity`)\n* `timeout` The number of ms before ending the session. When the timeout is reached, the system will end on the next attempt to read from the queue (Note: this has no use when `keepAlive` is `true`). (No default)\n* `logTo` An optional writable stream that all URLs attempting to be processed will be written to.\n* `urlFilter` An optional predicate function, taking the current `url` as a parameter, and returning `true` or `false` as to whether or not to include it in the hunt. Second argument of `domainFiltered` is a bool stating whether or not the host matches (use it if you'd like to include that check in your filter)\n* `before` and `after` callbacks receive nightmare instance and if defined, must return it (see [examples/preAuth.js](examples/preAuth.jss#L14-L26))\n* `nightmare` All [nightmare 2.8.1 options](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare/tree/2.8.1#nightmareoptions) are supported\n\n##Known Issues\n* `console.errors` not currently handled\n* `404`s are not currently handled\n* `/index.html` and `/` are not treated as the same URL, and are both processed\n* Subdomains (including `www`) are treated as different hosts\n* `unpipe()` won't stop the stream from finding results\n* links which are hidden in the page are still detected, could use [jQuery's approach](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/2d4f53416e5f74fa98e0c1d66b6f3c285a12f0ce/test/data/jquery-1.9.1.js#L7474) as an optional workaround\n\n##Examples\n\n```bash\nnpm i hounds\ncd node_modules/hounds/examples\nnpm i\n```\n\nThen try out `node .` for a basic example based on the test fixtures\n\n![hounds-simple](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/799038/19570264/41277d88-96c7-11e6-9060-83b7590c0cfb.gif)\n\nUnleash them on the latest sites from HackerNews via `node hackerNews`\n\nOr use them against a local site with auth (see [examples/preAuth.js](examples/preAuth.jss#L14-L26))\n\n![hounds-preauth](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/799038/19570191/ec2cd0a8-96c6-11e6-9586-f3b4fa9507b2.gif)\n\n##Changelog\n* ~~`0.2.0` Supports a single url with a promise~~\n* ~~`0.3.0` Stream support (instead of promises)~~\n    * ~~`0.3.1` Migrated to [nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) - 3x faster than Webdriver/Phantom2 and option to open up devTools~~\n    * ~~`0.3.2` Stream usage cleanup~~\n* ~~`0.4.0` Support to keep the session alive via `keepAlive`~~\n* ~~`0.5.0` Handles console errors that occur after `DOMContentLoaded` (with configurable timeout `waitAfterLoadedFor (ms)`). Follows links now.~~\n* ~~`0.6.0` Prevent visiting the same link twice.~~\n* ~~`0.7.0` Allow max number of links to follow or timeout.~~\n* ~~`0.8.0` Support for logTo writable stream for URLs processed, and correct error emitting bugfix.~~\n* ~~`0.9.0` By default, only links within same `hostname:port` are considered. Override with predicate function `urlFilter`~~\n* ~~`0.10.0` `urlFilter` also receives result of domain check as second argument. Bug fix: no dupes anchors in the one page~~\n* ~~`1.0.0` `before` and `after` callbacks receive nightmare instance and if defined, must return it (see [examples/preAuth.js](https://github.com/justinjmoses/hounds/blob/master/examples/preAuth.js))~~\n"
