  "readme": ":wave: Hi! I've been working on a desktop version of Git-it—same challenges, same result, just as its own app rather than something that runs in your terminal. You could give it a try if you'd like, download the one for your operating system here: [github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases](http://www.github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases). Eventually it will replace this terminal based version of Git-it :pizza:\n\n# Git-it\n\n| :computer: | What is this? |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![ss](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlord/git-it/master/git-it-ss.png) | A [workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper) module for learning Git and GitHub - Social coding, y'all. <br><br> These modules run a little app in your terminal and users work their way through the challenges. See [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io) for more.\n\n## Hello, future Forkers, Branchers and Pull Requesters!\n\nThis app runs in your Terminal (Mac) or Bash (Windows) and has challenges for learning Git and GitHub. It uses the _real_ terminal (so you'll be learning the awesome command line), it uses _real_ Git and GitHub which means when you finish all of the challenges you'll have _real_ repositories on your GitHub account and green squares on your [contribution chart](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions).\n\n![contributions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlord/git-it/master/ghcc.png)\n\nSee what topics are covered in Git-it on the [challenge table of contents](http://jlord.github.io/git-it) within the Git-it guide.\n\nDeveloper or workshop host? Useful links: [Contributing](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) //  [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOT.md) //  [New Version in Progress!](http://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron)\n\n### Get Started\n\nSections: [Install these first](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/blob/master/README.md#what-youll-need-to-run-git-it) // [Install Git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/blob/master/README.md#install-git-it) // [Using Git-it ](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/blob/master/README.md#how-it-works) // [Tips](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/blob/master/README.md#tips-for-getting-started)\n\n---\n\n### What you'll need to run Git-it:\n\n_A few development essentials, all are free and/or free and open source._\n\n- **Git**, this is your tracker of changes!\n - If you're on **Windows, download [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com)**, which includes Git, and use the **Git Shell** for your terminal.\n - If you're on a **Mac, download [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com)**, which includes Git, and select Preferences > Advanced > Install Command Line Tools.\n- **Node.js**, this is what this app is written in so you'll need this to run it. It's an engine for running JavaScript on servers (your computer is a server!) and will live quietly in the background. You can **download Node [here](http://nodejs.org/download/)** (For most, you can just pick the **Windows `.msi`** or **Mac `.pkg`** option).\n - If you already have Node and npm, make sure you have updated versions with at least v 1.4.3 for npm.\n- **Text Editor**, if you don't have one already, you may want one for editing code*. A few options: [Atom](http://www.atom.io), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), [Textmate](http://macromates.com/download), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).\n- **English locales**, since the backend is English only at the moment. If you are using different language on your system, please refer to the corresponding section in the file [TROUBLESHOOT.md](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOT.md).\n\n_*There actually isn't \"coding\" required to complete Git-it so you're fine to use the default Notepad or TextEdit that comes with Mac/PC._\n\n### Install Git-it\n\nOnce you have the essentials above, install Git-it.\n\n- Open up a terminal window and install Git-it globally on your computer (so that you can run it from anywhere). [NPM](http://www.npmjs.org) (**which is included when you download Node.js**) delivers Node.js modules (that's what this app is) to your computer from the command line, real easy like:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g git-it\n```\n- _If you run into trouble with this command it may be due to permissions on your computer, **try adding 'sudo'**:_ `sudo npm install -g git-it`\n- Once it's done installing components, you can run it:\n\n```bash\n$ git-it\n```\n- This should load the menu. You're ready to go! Select the first challenge, hit enter and you're on your way!\n\n### How it Works\n\n- Once you've run `git-it` and the menu has loaded, use the arrows ↑↓ to select the first challenge and press 'enter'.\n- With the challenge loaded, follow the instructions at the bottom of the input to open the guide. _Preview a web hosted version of the guide [here](http://jlord.github.io/git-it)._\n\n![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlord/git-it/master/guide-ss.png)\n\n- Read the instructions in the guide and use your terminal to complete the tasks.\n- When you're done with a challenge, type `git-it verify` in terminal.\n- If the challenge components were not completed correctly, Git-it returns some text to help you know what went wrong.\n- Run `git-it` again to load the menu and select the next challenge!\n\n**If you have any questions about something, just create a [new issue](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/issues/new) or visit the [troubleshooting doc](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOT.md).**\n\n---\n\n### Tips For Getting Started\n\n**Code snippets** often times look like `$ some code-stuff --here`. The dollar sign identifies the line as one a user would enter into the the command line, but you don't actually include it when you type it into terminal. In this case, you'd actually just type `some code-stuff --here`.\n\n**Variables** are indicated by `<VARIABLENAME>` in code snippets. When you actually use the line of code, replace it, including the `<>`, with your variable. For instance to make a new folder in terminal the format is, `mkdir <FOLDERNAME>`, so if you wanted to make a folder named 'octocat', you'd type: `mkdir octocat`.\n\n**Command line, terminal, bash** all basically mean the same thing: the MS-DOS, Doogie Howser looking screen full of words and numbers. It's awesomely powerful and allows you to control your computer with text commands.\n\nYou can do a lot of things from your terminal like delete, rename, copy or create files and folders; run scripts and send things back and forth between servers (like the ones storing things on GitHub.com) and your computer (also a server!).\n"
