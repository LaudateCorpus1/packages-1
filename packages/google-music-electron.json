  "readme": "# google-music-electron [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/google-music-electron.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/google-music-electron)\n\nDesktop app for [Google Music][] on top of [Electron][]\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Google Music as a standalone application\n- Tray for quick play/pause/quit and tooltip with information\n- Media key shortcuts\n- MPRIS integration (for GNU/Linux desktop environments)\n\n![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)\n\nThis was written as a successsor to [google-music-webkit][]. When upgrading between versions of [nw.js][], there were regressions with taskbar and shortcut bindings. We wrote this as an alternative.\n\n[Google Music]: https://play.google.com/music/listen\n[Electron]: http://electron.atom.io/\n[google-music-webkit]: https://github.com/twolfson/google-music-webkit\n[nw.js]: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js\n\n## Requirements\n- [npm][], usually installed with [node][]\n\n[npm]: http://npmjs.org/\n[node]: http://nodejs.org/\n\n## Getting Started\n`google-music-electron` can be installed globally via `npm`:\n\n```js\n# Install google-music-electron via npm\nnpm install -g google-music-electron\n\n# Run google-music-electron\ngoogle-music-electron\n```\n\nWhen the application has launched, it will appear in your taskbar and via a tray icon, ![tray icon](lib/assets/icon.png).\n\n![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)\n\n## Newsletter\nInterested in hearing about updates and new releases of `google-music-electron`?\n\n[Subscribe to our newsletter!](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-music-electron)\n\n## MPRIS integration\nIf you are on GNU/Linux and your desktop environment supports [MPRIS][], you can install our [MPRIS][] integration via:\n\n```bash\ngoogle-music-electron install-mpris\n# Once this succeeds, MRPIS will be integrated on `google-music-electron` restart\n```\n\n![MPRIS screenshot](docs/mpris-screenshot.png)\n\n[MPRIS]: http://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/\n\n## Updating\n`google-music-electron` can be updated via `npm`:\n\n```js\n# Update google-music-electron to a newer version via npm\nnpm update -g google-music-electron\n# Alternatively, the following can be used as well to specify a version\n# npm install -g google-music-electron@latest\n```\n\n## Documentation\n### CLI\nWe have a few CLI options available for you:\n\n```\n  Usage: google-music-electron [options] [command]\n\n\n  Commands:\n\n    install-mpris   Install integration with MPRIS (Linux only)\n\n  Options:\n\n    -h, --help                  output usage information\n    -V, --version               output the version number\n    -S, --skip-taskbar          Skip showing the application in the taskbar\n    --minimize-to-tray          Hide window to tray instead of minimizing\n    --hide-via-tray             Hide window to tray instead of minimizing (only for tray icon)\n    --allow-multiple-instances  Allow multiple instances of `google-music-electron` to run\n    --verbose                   Display verbose log output in stdout\n    --debug-repl                Starts a `replify` server as `google-music-electron` for debugging\n```\n\n## Development\n### Running locally\nTo get a local development copy running, you will need:\n\n- [npm][], usually installed with [node][]. Same `npm` that is used during installation\n- [git][], version control tool\n\n[git]: http://git-scm.com/\n\nFollow the steps below to get a development copy set up:\n\n```bash\n# Clone our repository\ngit clone https://github.com/twolfson/google-music-electron.git\ncd google-music-electron/\n\n# Install our dependencies and dev dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Start up `google-music-electron`\nnpm start\n```\n\nAfter running the above steps, a copy of `google-music-electron` should begin running.\n\n![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)\n\n#### Adding local setup as a global installation\nAfter getting our local development set up, we can go one step further and get `google-music-electron` working on our CLI as if it were installed via `npm install -g`.\n\n```bash\n# Link local copy as a global copy\n# WARNING: Make sure that `npm install` has been run before this point\n#   or your local copy's permissions may get messed up\nnpm link\n\n# Run `google-music-electron` for local copy\ngoogle-music-electron\n```\n\nMore information on `npm link` can be found in `npm's` documentation:\n\nhttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link\n\n### Icons\nSource images are kept in the `resources/` folder. Icons are maintained via Inkscape and the `play/pause` buttons are isolated in layers.\n\nTo generate icons:\n\n1. Export each of the play/pause/clean variants as a `.svg` file\n2. Load the icons via GIMP as a 32x32 SVG\n3. Export via GIMP as a `.png`\n\nAt the time of writing, Inkscape and Image Magick seemed to be generating non-transparent backgrounds upon converting SVG to PNG.\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint via `npm run lint` and test via `npm test`.\n\n## Donating\nSupport this project and [others by twolfson][gratipay] via [gratipay][].\n\n[![Support via Gratipay][gratipay-badge]][gratipay]\n\n[gratipay-badge]: https://cdn.rawgit.com/gratipay/gratipay-badge/2.x.x/dist/gratipay.png\n[gratipay]: https://www.gratipay.com/twolfson/\n\n## Attribution\nHeadphones designed by Jake Dunham from [the Noun Project][headphones-icon]\n\n[headphones-icon]: http://thenounproject.com/term/headphones/16097/\n\n## Unlicense\nAs of May 16 2015, Todd Wolfson has released this repository and its contents to the public domain.\n\nIt has been released under the [UNLICENSE][].\n\n[UNLICENSE]: UNLICENSE\n"
