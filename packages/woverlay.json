  "readme": "# woverlay\n\n## Status\n\nThis module is a work in progress as the version number indicates.\nI'm currently using it as the basis for a couple projects, but as of 0.0.x haven't even tested beyond a local network.\nOnce the module is stabilized I'll document the api.\n\n## What is it?\n\nThe w in \"woverlay\" is for WebRTC; woverlay is a peer 2 peer overlay network built on WebRTC.\nDepending on your disposition you can read it as a Keanu Reeves \"woah\" or a more shakespearean \"woe\".\nThe network is similar a variant of a \"Chord\" network.\n\nThe architecture uses a central websocket server for bootstrapping into the network.\nOnce a peer is bootstrapped it uses WebRTC for building the rest of the network and signaling, so the load on the server should be minimal.\n\n* No effort to support browsers that don't have WebRTC, so most ES6 features can be used without transpiling (browserify, but no need to babelify).\n* Requires bootstrapping peers to connect in both directions with only STUN servers, asymmetric NATs and tight firewalls won't be able to join the network.\n"
