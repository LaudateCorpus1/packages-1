  "readme": "infusion-electron\n=================\n\nInfusion-Electron is a collection of [Fluid Infusion](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion) components that make it easier to use [Atom Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron).\n\nUsing Infusion-Electron\n-----------------------\n\n### Deduplicating Infusion\n\nFluid Infusion requires that a single instance of its module be loaded per Node.js application. To ensure that you don't have multiple copies of Infusion installed, you'll need to use the [dedupe-infusion](https://github.com/fluid-project/dedupe-infusion) after installing (or prior to running) your application. Here's how:\n\nIn your <code>package.json</code>, you'll need to declare a dependency on <code>dedupe-infusion</code>:\n\n    {\n        \"dependencies\": {\n            \"dedupe-infusion\": \"1.0.0\"\n        }\n    }\n\nAnd you'll also want to include a script that takes care of deduplicating after installation. Please note that npm's postinstall scripts are susceptible to race conditions and aren't appropriate for this task.\n\n    {\n        \"scripts\": {\n            \"dedupe-infusion\": \"node -e \\\"require('dedupe-infusion')()\\\"\",\n            \"fullinstall\": \"npm install && npm run dedupe-infusion\"\n        }\n    }\n\nTo install your application, you can run:\n\n    npm run fullinstall\n\nAttribution and License\n-----------------------\n\nThis library was written by Colin Clark and is distributed under the \"new\" BSD 3-clause license.\n"
