  "readme": "# Noxious\nNoxious is designed to be a secure, decentralized, and anonymous instant messaging platform.\n##Anonymous\nAll communications are conducted between [tor hidden services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en) and never leave the tor network.\n##Secure\nIn addition to the encryption offered by the tor hidden service protocol, all chat messages are\nRSA public-key encrypted using a 3072 bit key.  All crytography is handled by the [forge module](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge).  Although forge is 100%\nJavaScript, it does access the CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure Random Number\nGenerator) provided by the native openssl library via a call to [node's crypto.randomBytes\nfunction](https://iojs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback).\n##Platform\nNoxious is built on the [Electron Application Shell](http://electron.atom.io/).\n##Screenshot\n![noxious screenshot](https://github.com/mattcollier/noxious/blob/screenshots/screenshot1.png)\n###Operating System Support\nThe current version has been tested on 32bit and 64bit version of Debian Linux,\nOSX 64bit\n##### Installation Instructions\n###### Node.js\n[Get Node.js here.](https://nodejs.org).  npm, node package manager will be included with the other Node.js binaries.\n\n######Clone and Build\nNext, as a **regular user**, clone this repository into the folder of your choice:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/mattcollier/noxious.git\ncd noxious\nnpm install\n```\nThe 'npm install' command will download all the required dependencies.\n#####Run Noxious\nFrom inside the noxious folder do:\n```\nnpm start\n```\nYou should see the GUI appear.  Within 30 seconds or so, you should see your 'Chat ID'\nappear next to the asterisk (*) in the upper left hand corner of the window.  \nYou may now provide your Chat ID to another Noxious user who can add you as a\ncontact which initiates a 'contact request' process which facilitates the\nexchange of public keys.\n###Support\nPlease [submit an issue](https://github.com/mattcollier/noxious/issues).  We can\nalso be reached via irc at #noxious on freenode.\n##Noxious Chat Bot\nThe [Noxious Chat Bot](https://github.com/mattcollier/noxiousChatBot) is\navailable for testing.  The bot is console based and utilizes native openssl\nlibraries for crypto.  Successful communication between the Noxious Client and\nthe Noxious Chat Bot demonstrates that the JavaScript forge module utilized\nin the Noxious client is openssl compatible.\n"
