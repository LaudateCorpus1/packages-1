  "readme": "# Dataface\nDesktop application to manage Postgres databases (**Work in Progress**)\n\n## Background\nHave you ever wanted to open a database, create a table, add a few fields and some data?\nSo has just about every other developer! So why is there no free, open source, multi-platform\napplication with a modern-looking UI available? And if there were, it would probably be just\nfor one flavor of database.\n\nDataface aims to be just that, and hopefully for multiple flavors of database (at least Postgres\nand MySQL, maybe more). It won't be as fully-featured as some of the other tools out there,\nbut it will provide the simple stuff simply.\n\n## Technology\nDataface is a JavaScript application using the \n[:steam_locomotive::train::train::train::train::train:](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo/)\n[choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo/)\nframework. It's almost entirely client-side, but since it needs to access databases, it's\nbuilt as a cross-platform desktop application using [electron](http://electron.atom.io/).\n\n## Development\n* Clone the repository and install dependencies via `npm install`\n* Run the electron app via `npm start`\n"
