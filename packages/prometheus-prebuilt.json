  "readme": "# prometheus-prebuilt\n\nInstall [prometheus][] prebuilt binaries for command-line\nuse using npm. This module helps you easily install the `prometheus` command\nfor use on the command line without having to compile anything.\n\n> [Prometheus][] is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally\nbuilt at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and\norganizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active\ndeveloper and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and\nmaintained independently of any company.\n~ https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/#what-is-prometheus\n\n[Prometheus]: https://prometheus.io/\n[prometheus]: https://prometheus.io/\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload and install the latest build of prometheus for your OS and add it to\nyour projects `package.json`:\n\n```\nnpm install prometheus-prebuilt --save-dev\n```\n\nThis is the preferred way to use prometheus, as it doesn't require users to\ninstall prometheus globally.\n\nYou can also use the `-g` flag (global) to symlink it into your PATH:\n\n```\nnpm install -g prometheus-prebuilt\n```\n\nNow you can just run `prometheus` to run prometheus:\n\n```\n$ prometheus --help\nusage: prometheus [<args>]\n\n\n   -version false\n      Print version information.\n\n   -config.file \"prometheus.yml\"\n      Prometheus configuration file name.\n\n   ...\n```\n\n## Options\n\n## os\n\nIf you want to change the OS version that is downloaded (e.g., `windows` on a\n`linux` machine), you can use the `--os` flag with npm install or set the\n`npm_config_os` environment variable:\n\n```\nnpm install --os=windows prometheus-prebuilt\n```\n\n## version\n\nBinaries are downloaded from [github repo\nreleases](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases).\n\nDefault version is always the\n[latest](https://api.github.com/repos/prometheus/prometheus/releases/latest)\none, unless you use `--version` flag with npm install or set the\n`npm_config_version` environment variable:\n\n```\nnpm install --version=\"0.18.0\" prometheus-prebuilt\n```\n\n## About\n\nWorks on OSes that prometheus supports: https://prometheus.io/download/\n\nThe version numbers of this module should match the version number of the\n[offical prometheus\nreleases](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases).\n\nA pre-release version may be used to have a lower precedence versionning\nspecific to prometheus-prebuilt package.\n\n---\n\n> Based on https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-prebuilt/\n"
