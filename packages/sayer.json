  "readme": "# Sayer - The Tiny But Fully Functional RTE for the Web\n\nCurrently very buggy, but only due to massive refactoring.  And more\nrefactoring is going to be needed. But soon. Ish.  Hopefully by the middle of\nsummer this will be ready in all of its glory.\n\nAnd now for some quotes to distract you from the mess.\n\nAlways the seer is a __sayer__. Somehow his dream is told: somehow he publishes it\nwith solemn joy: sometimes with pencil on canvas: sometimes with chisel on\nstone; sometimes in towers and aisles of granite, his soul's worship is\nbuilded; sometimes in anthems of indefinite music; but clearest and most\npermanent, in words. \n- Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n(...) we will call here, the Knower, the Doer, and the __Sayer__. These stand\nrespectively for the love of truth, for the love of good, and for the love of\nbeauty.\n\n- Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\n## Why ?\n\nSimply because there are no other really good, bare-bone text editors using\n`contentEditable`. Most browsers behave very differently in handling\nline breaks, new blocks, backspaces, deletes, formatting etc. So basically\nwe have overriden all these actions with our own DOM manipulating actions.\nThe only things we use native actions for is actual typing and text traversal (arrow buttons,\npage up, etc). Even the undo/redo has been completely replaced to allow us to modify\nthe DOM howerver we like, but still be able to go back to previous changes.\nThis might sound like a daunting task, but it turned out to be quite simple.\nAnd thus it is also very small, just look below.\n\nCurrent functions are styling text with italic, bold or underline. Change\nbetween P, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 and H6 blocks for text. Create ordered and\nunordered lists and undo/redo (in the seperate module snapback).\n\n## Sayer is Tiny\n\nThough \n          | Unminified  | Minified  | Compressed\n----------|-------------|-----------|-------------\njQuery\t\t| Doesn't count| Doesn't count |\nSayer     | 33.1kb      | 19.5kb    |\nSnapback  | 6.69kb      | 2.94kb    |\nSelectron | 6.27kb      | 3kb       |\nTotal:    | 46.06kb     | 35.44kb   |\n\n\n### Comparison to Other RTE's\n\n## Compatability\n\nCAUTION: This chart is not up to chart.
