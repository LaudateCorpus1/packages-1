  "readme": "# Uplift CUP (CSV Upload Program)\n\nThis app is designed to process csv files from Paypal or Stripe.\nIt will produce a number of output csv files properly processed for upload to Engaging Networks.\nThe plan is to wrap it into an electron app so anyone in the company can easily complete the upload process.\n\n## Getting data\n\nFor Paypal you can [download from here](https://history.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_history-download).\nJust make sure you select all transactions in the period since the last upload... If you don't know when that is, you \nneed to check or you will end up with duplicates.\n\nFor Stripe you should go to [all payments on the dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) and set the filters\nto the correct period. Once again, if you're unsure on the period, find out before processing or you will cause \nduplication.\n\n## Using the app\n\nAt the moment you need to use the commandline. This will be ported to an Electron app soon so it can be used on any\ncomputer.\n\n## Uploading output\n\nI don't think uploading is within scope of this app, although it wouldn't be much of an extra step to incorporate \na EN transactional import step.\n\n## Rights\n\nThis app was created for Uplift by Adam Harrington. All rights reserved by [Uplift](https://uplift.ie). "
