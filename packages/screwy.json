(Formerly npm-scripts-gui)\n\n<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg\">\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img height=\"250\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samueleaton/design/master/npmsg.png\">  \n</p>\n<br>\n\n*Tested on OS X Yosemite, OS X El Capitan, and Ubuntu*\n\n## Installation  \n\nInstall as a Dev Dependency  \n```\nnpm i -D screwy\n```\n\n...Or Install Globally  \n```\nnpm i -g screwy\n```\n\nInstalling as a dev dependency allows anyone who downloads your project to also get access to the gui... for free!\n\n## Launching\n\nTo launch Screwy, you must be in a directory with a ` package.json ` file.   \n\n**If Installed Globally**\n\nThen simply run:  ` screwy `\n\n**If Installed as a Dev Dependency (Recommended)**\n\nYou must create an npm script task in the ` package.json ` that runs the ` screwy ` command and then you would run ` npm run <command_name> ` from the terminal. \n\n```json\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"screwy\": \"screwy\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nInstalling as a dev dependency is recommended because it allows the Screwy to be bundled with your project and available for everyone who run `npm i` in your project.\n\n<br>\n\n\n## Seeing Output  \n\nWhether Screwy is installed globally or as a dependency, any text output associated with any npm script task will be printed to the command line where Screwy was launched. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samueleaton/design/master/nsg.gif\">  \n</p>\n<br>\n\n\n## Quiting the App  \n\nTo **quit** the app, it is safer to close the actual renderer window rather than quiting the process from the command line. If quiting from the command line, Screwy may not do the check to make sure all processes are killed before closing. \n\n## Killing a Running Script   \n\nDouble Click a running button.\n\nProcesses will die automatically when they finish or when the app is closed, but there may be times when you want to manually kill a process.\n\nYou can also use the `KILL` command with file watching and hotkeys.\n\n## File Watching\n\nYou can tell Screwy to watch files and how to respond to those changes. You need to create a `watch` block in the  `.screwyrc` file. You can watch directories, files, and use the `*` and `**` wildcards. \n\nAfter specifying a path, you need to specify **which** npm script task to respond to the file change and **how** it should respond. There are 3 options regarding the type of action to perform:\n\n- **`START`** (default, may be excluded)\n-  **`KILL`**\n- **`RESTART`** (if the task is running, this will kill it and start it)\n\n**NOTE:** A whitespace is required after any of the keywords.\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"watch\": {\n        \"src/scripts/*.js\": \"RESTART transpile-scripts\",\n        \"./index.js\": \"RESTART start-server\",\n        \"src/styles\": \"stylus\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example, the first watcher will restart the `transpile-scripts` task when any `.js` files are changed at `src/scripts`. The second watcher will apparently restart the server when the `index.js` file is changed. The last watcher will run `START stylus` (`START` is default).\n\n## Watching Other Commands\n\nYou can tell Screwy to run a command whenever another specific command finishes. Within the same block as file watching, simply replace the file path with `CMD <command_name>`\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"watch\": {\n        \"CMD transpile-scripts\": \"RESTART start-server\",\n        \"./index.js\": \"RESTART start-server\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example, the `RESTART start-server` command will run every time the `transpile-scripts` command finishes and when `index.js` is changed.\n\n## Hotkeys  \n\nEver wanted to run an npm script by hitting a key combination on your keyboard?\n\nHotkey combinations are configurable in the ` .screwyrc ` file. These allow you to trigger any npm scripts without needing to even click on the button or even being focused on the GUI window. \n\nAgain, you can have the GUI window minimized and the hotkeys will still trigger button clicks, and output will be sent to the terminal.\n\nHotkeys are defined in the ` .screwyrc ` file. They require the name of the hotkey combination as the key and the npm script as the value. \n\nJust as with file watching, the `START`, `RESTART`, and `KILL` commands may be used with the npm task name.  \n\n```json\n{\n    \"hotkeys\": {\n        \"Control+Cmd+Alt+s\": \"start\",\n        \"Control+Cmd+Alt+r\": \"RESTART start\",\n        \"Control+Cmd+Alt+k\": \"KILL start\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, assuming the `start` command's job is to spin up a server, then `Control+Cmd+Alt+s` would start the server if it weren't on, `Control+Cmd+Alt+r` would restart it if it was running, and `Control+Cmd+Alt+k` would shut it down (kill it). \n\n### Multi-platform Compatibility\n\nIf you expect others to run Screwy on a different platform than you are developing on, you will need to specify the platform to avoid conflicts.\n\nFor Mac, use: `OSX` or `darwin`\n\nFor Linux, use: `linux`\n\n```json\n{\n    \"hotkeys\": {\n        \"darwin\": {\n            \"Control+Cmd+Alt+s\": \"start\",\n            \"Control+Cmd+Alt+r\": \"RESTART start\",\n            \"Control+Cmd+Alt+k\": \"KILL start\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMore hotkey examples are in the Configurations section.\n\n## Configurations  \n\nScrewy will automatically search for a ` .screwyrc ` in the same directory as the ` package.json `. It should be in json format.\n\nThese are the available options:\n- **name**, choose different name than defined in ` package.json `\n- **primary**, the primary script buttons (red buttons) for scripts that will be ran more frequently\n- **exclude**, scripts to NOT include in the GUI\n- **alwaysOnTop**, whether the window is always in front of other windows\n- **theme**, choose a light or dark theme for window\n- **width**, the initial window width\n- **height**, the initial window height\n- **watch**, specify paths to watch and tasks to respond to file changes\n- **hotkeys**, define hotkey combinations that will trigger npm scripts\n- **silent**, suppress all of the npm's native error message and error log. (This is good for tests or linting, where you usually get error messages anyways.)\n\n* .screwyrc Example**  \n\n```\n{\n    \"name\": \"Qualtrics to SFDC\",\n    \"primary\": [\"build\", \"run-production\", \"run-sandbox\"],\n    \"exclude\": [\"scripts-gui\", \"prebuild\"],\n    \"silent\": [\"lint\", \"test\"]\n    \"alwaysOnTop\": true,\n    \"theme\": \"dark\",\n    \"width\": 500,\n    \"watch\": {\n        \"src/scripts/*.js\": \"RESTART production\",\n        \"src/styles\": \"RESTART stylus\"\n    },\n    \"hotkeys\": {\n        \"Control+Alt+b\": \"build\",\n        \"Shift+Command+1\": \"run-production\",\n        \"Shift+Command+2\": \"run-sandbox\",\n        \"Control+Cmd+Alt+r\": \"RESTART run-production\",\n        \"Control+Cmd+Alt+k\": \"KILL run-production\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAny script not specified in ` primary ` or ` exclude ` will show up as a normal button.\n"
