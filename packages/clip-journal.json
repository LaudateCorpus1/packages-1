  "readme": "# clip-journal\n\nSeamlessly record your activities in a journal while you work, by making a copy of anything in the system clipboard.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm i -g electron\nnpm i -g clip-journal\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can start a journal anywhere. Just provide the path to a markdown file (it will be created if it doesn't already exist)\n\n```sh\nmkdir my-journal\nclip my-journal/index.md\n```\n\nNow whenever you copy some text to the clipboard it will be appended to `index.md`, and if you copy an image it will be saved to the directory and embedded in the markdown file.\n\n_Tip for OSX users:_ `Cmd-Ctrl-Shift-4` saves a screenshot to the clipboard rather than to a file\n\n## Live preview\n\nYou might also like to use something like [`vmd`](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/vmd) to get a live preview of the journal:\n\n```sh\nvmd index.md\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
