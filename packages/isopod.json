The script will make `isopod` a global variable.\n\nFor example you might run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install isopod\n``` \n\n...and then you might put this in your html (assuming the `node_modules` directory is statically served to the client):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/isopod/dist/isopod.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n...and now `isopod` would be a global variable available to any subsequent client scripts.\n\n# What does it include?\n\n`isopod` has but two methods: `serialize` and `deserialize`.\n\n# Why would I use it?\n\nNormally when you send some Javascript data from one program (e.g. your server) to another (e.g. your client) it loses \"richness\". Functions, regular expressions, circular objects, objects with non-standard prototypes—all of these things *would not* normally transfer over.\n\nOne way to think about why this happens is that any data that gets sent somewhere else by your Javascript program will (basically) need to get converted into a string, and is generally converted back into data (parsed) on the receiving end. Commonly the sender will `JSON.stringify` the data and the receiver will `JSON.parse` the incoming string.\n\nThis means that Javascript objects get converted into JSON strings, which are only natively equipped to represent plain objects, plain arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null.\n\n`isopod.serialize` converts anything more complex than that into a plain object so that it can be stringified. Importantly this plain, \"dehydrated\", object still contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the details of the original. As such, when parsed on the other end, we should get a clone of the dehydrated object. `isopod.deserialize` can \"rehydrate\" this into a clone of the original.\n\nAny change that occurs to the cloned object **will not** affect the original and vice-versa. Those objects exist in different runtimes and cannot directly affect each other. If you want automated synchronization, `isopod` is not that, though you could build something like that \"on top\" of it.\n\nWith `isopod` you can remotely clone:\n\n* Plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null (these are no different than what you can do *without* `isopod`)\n* `undefined`, ±`Infinity`, and `NaN`\n* Functions (but not [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures), nor [bound](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) functions)\n* Regular expressions\n* Errors\n* Dates\n* Symbols\n* Sets\n* Maps\n* Anything with a non-standard prototype\n* Anything with circular or duplicate references to the same object or symbol\n* Array buffers / typed arrays / data views\n\nNote that cloning will exclude non-enumerable properties (except for the `.constructor` property—this in order to clone prototypes effectively). Here's a not-necessarily complete list of what you might not *yet* be able to clone:\n\n* Promises¹\n* Generators\n* Proxies\n\n¹ The plan is never to support cloning promises—it involves cloning too much hairy state for a non-obvious use case. If you're looking to resolve any values on an object, you could do so and then pass the result to `isopod.serialize`. Check out [bluebird's `Promise.props`](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.props.html) or even [promise-resolve-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise-resolve-deep) for help resolving inside an object.\n\n# How would I use it?\n\nInstall and include `isopod` into both environments: client and server, one iframe and another iframe, [tessel](https://tessel.io/) and [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) app—whatever two Javascript runtimes you want to clone data between.\n\nThen for any data you'd like to \"richly clone\", just before sending it across call `isopod.serialize` on it. Just after parsing the data on the other end call `isopod.deserialize` on it.\n\nFor example, you might have an [express](http://expressjs.com/) route handler on your node server that looks like:\n\n```js\n...\n// an example of some data that is sufficiently complex\nfunction Thing (names) {\n  this.self = this;\n  this.names = new Set(names);\n}\nThing.prototype.jump = function () {\n  this.state = 'jumping';\n};\nconst thing = new Thing(['robert', 'bob', 'rob']);\n...\napp.get('/thing', function (req, res, next) {\n  const serialized = isopod.serialize(thing);\n  res.json(serialized);\n});\n...\n```\n\nAnd an AJAX request on your client that looks like:\n\n```js\n...\nfetch('/thing')\n.then(function (response) {\n  return response.json();\n})\n.then(function (jsonObj) {\n  const deserialized = isopod.deserialize(jsonObj);\n  // should now be able to do the following\n  deserialized.names.has('bob'); // => true\n  deserialized.jump();\n  console.log(deserialized.state); // 'jumping'\n  console.log(deserialized.self === deserialized); // true\n});\n...\n```\n\nFor something more concrete, you can find runnable examples in the examples folder.\n\n# Similar libraries\n\n* [serialize-javascript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialize-javascript)\n* [serialijse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialijse)\n* [node-serialize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-serialize)\n* [lave](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lave)\n* [picklejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picklejs)\n* [serialization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialization)\n* [unserializable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unserializable)\n\n# Contributing\n\nPull requests / issues / comments / hate mail welcome!\n\nIf you'd like to run the tests, download this repo, open a terminal, navigate to it, then run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n...and once that's done:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n"
