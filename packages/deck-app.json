  "readme": "# deck-app\n\nThis allows a Node 0.10 (or npm 1) users to install `@deck/app`\n\n[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com/)\n\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm i -g deck-app # node .10\n```\n\nIf you're using (or have access to) Node .12 or Node 4 (and therefore npm 2+) you'll be better off installing <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deck/app>. \n\nOnce installed switching Node versions shouldn't require\na reinstall anyway. \n\n\n## CLI\n\n```sh\ndeck <command> [arguments]\n```\n\nThe `@deck/app` module acts as an entry point and CLI tool for deck.\n\nTo learn how to use the GUI (e.g. global hot keys) see <https://github.com/nearform/deck-gui>\n\n### Commands\n\n#### Create\n\nA slide deck is a \"content module\": a folder with at least a\n`package.json` and `deck.md` file.\n\n\n```javascript\ndeck init\n```\n\nAnalogous to `npm init`, the `deck init` command provisions\na folder with the files that make up a slide deck. \n\n#### Get Dependencies\n\n```javascript\ndeck install\n```\n\nMuch like `npm install` when run without options `deck install` will install dependencies for a slide deck (generally we would do this after a `deck init`)\n\n#### Fetch\n\n```javascript\ndeck install <slide deck name>\n```\n\nWhen a slide deck is specified, `deck` will use npm to download \nand install the content module. Unlike an npm install, the resulting\nslide deck folder will placed in the current working directory instead\nof a `node_modules` folder. Otherwise all other `npm` behaviours apply (e.g. will lookup from repo as per `npm config` etc.)\n\n#### Present\n\n```sh\ndeck present [<slide deck path>] [!]\n```\n\nWhen run in a slide deck folder, this will build a presentation from the `deck.md` file in the current folder then open `@deck/gui` for viewing and presenting. \n\nIf a path to a slide deck is supplied it will likewise be presented.\n\nA special syntax `deck present !` instructs `deck` to present the \nmost recently installed content module. \n\n#### Edit\n\n```sh\ndeck edit [<slide deck path>]\n```\n\nOpens a slide decks `deck.md` file in the default systen editor (as per the `$EDITOR` environment variable). If given a path the `deck.md` file at the supplied path will be opened, otherwise a `deck.md` in the current folder will be opened.\n\n#### Upstream\n\n```sh\ndeck upstream [<slide deck path>]\n```\n\nCreates a new branch on GitHub, pushes modified content and \nmakes a pull request with the change. \n\nThe slide deck does not need to be a git repository for `upstream`\nto function - however Github keys are required (see https://github.com/nearform/deck-upstream)\n\nIf a path is not supplied, the current folder is assumed.\n\n## Technologies\n\nThe deck system is built on and/or utilizes:\n\n* [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)\n* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)\n* [Bespoke.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js/)\n* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\n* [YAML](http://yaml.org)\n* [NPM](http://npmjs.org)\n* [GitHub](http://github.com)\n\n![](anatomy.png)\n\n## Ecosystem\n\nTo view other pieces of the deck system see <https://github.com/nearform/deck>\n\n## Issues and PR's\n\n* Please open any issues for any deck related module on the <https://github.com/nearform/deck> community repo.\n* Any module specific PR's are welcomed on the corresponding repo.\n\n## Credits\n\nSponsored by <a href=\"http://nearform.com\">nearForm</a>\n\n### Contributors\n\n  * David Mark Clements\n  * Mihai Dima\n  * Cristian Kiss\n\n### Contributing\n\nDeck is an **OPEN Open Source Project**. This means that:\n\n> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to a project to contribute as they see fit. A project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.\n\nSee the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more details.\n\n"
