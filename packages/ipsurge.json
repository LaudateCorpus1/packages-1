Publish your application using `ipsurge publish`\n- 2. Save the hash returned\n- 3. Pick one of the public IPFS nodes IP addresses\n```\n$ dig +short ipfs.io\n178.62.61.185\n178.62.158.247\n104.236.76.40\n104.236.151.122\n104.236.176.52\n104.236.179.241\n128.199.219.111\n162.243.248.213\n```\n- 4. Go into your DNS provider and add a A record of yourdomain.com pointing to ipfs.io and a TXT record with dnslink=<hash returned in step 2>\n- 4. Wait a little bit for DNS to propagate\n- 5. open yourdomain.com and see that your page was loaded! \n\nVoil√°, your page is now cached and being served by IPFS\n\nnote: you can also host your own IPFS nodes and use the same DNS trick.\n"
