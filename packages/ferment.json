  "readme": "<h1 align=\"center\">\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://ferment.audio\"><img src=\"/ferment-logo.png\" alt=\"WebTorrent\" width=\"200\"></a>\n  <br>\n  Ferment\n  <br>\n  <br>\n</h1>\n\n[Ferment](http://ferment.audio) is a peer-to-peer audio sharing and streaming application. It is an attempted re-creation of classic SoundCloud, but runs entirely decentralized instead of one corporation and its investors holding all the power.\n\nIt is made possible by combining these **amazing** projects: [ssb](https://scuttlebot.io/), [webtorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) and [electron](http://electron.atom.io/).\n\n![](/assets/ferment-screenshot-0.0.0.jpg)\n\n## Experimental // EVERYTHING IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND BREAKING!\n\nI'm just fiddling with ideas right now. My goal is to replace my need for SoundCloud as a [backyard musician that uploads WAY to much stuff](https://soundcloud.com/destroy-with-science). I no longer want to pay them $200 a year to host it all (also sick of being told to pay more money to get SoundCloud Go and having my feed ransomed out from underneath me).\n\n### The long-term vision ✨\n\nI want to see a thriving audio sharing community (actually would be COMMUNITIES! it's decentralized), a lot like SoundCloud used to encourage before it had to MONETIZE and start trying to make a profit (AND OH NOEZ, WE'RE GOING BANKRUPT 😞). Pretty sure that SoundCloud was doomed from the start (so glad we had all these great years off the pocket of those investors), but a _peer-to-peer decentralized not-for-profit open source_ might just work!\n\n**It will also soon be possible to host your own server that allows people without the app to stream music from your profile (or others that you want to seed).** This will still be peer-to-peer but your server will act as a mirror and tracker.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **You need `ffmpeg` installed to add audio files!** Otherwise you'll just receive an error when you choose the file.\n- If there is no [packaged app](https://github.com/mmckegg/ferment/releases) for your platform, you'll need a modern version of [`node` and `npm`](https://nodejs.org)\n- To build from source or npm you currently need to have `automake` and `libtool`\n\n## Install\n\n### on macOS\n\nDownload the latest release [here](https://github.com/mmckegg/ferment/releases)!\n\n**Make sure you read the section of this readme titled [\"Joining Pub Server\"](#joining-pub-server)!**\n\n### from npm\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g ferment\n```\n\nAnd then run using:\n\n```bash\n$ ferment\n```\n\nIf you get an error appear saying something like [`Module version mismatch. Expected 50, got 48.`](https://github.com/mmckegg/ferment/issues/5), try running the following:\n\n```bash\n# requires automake on your system\n$ ferment --rebuild\n```\n\nInstall latest updates:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g ferment@latest\n```\n\n### from source\n\n**Warning:** Development is done on the master branch, so this could be broken right now!\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/mmckegg/ferment.git\n$ cd ferment\n$ npm install\n```\n\nAnd then run using:\n\n```bash\n$ npm start\n```\n\nInstall latest updates:\n\n```bash\n$ npm update\n$ npm run rebuild # make sure native add-ons are compatible with electron version\n```\n\n## Joining Pub Server\n\nBy default, **Ferment** will only see other users that are on the same local area network as you. In order to share with users on the internet, you need to be invited to a pub server.\n\nSince I'm a nice person 💖 you can hang out in my pub, and you don't even have to buy any drinks! 🍻\n\n**Click 'Join Pub' on the sidebar then paste the code below:**\n\n```\npub.ferment.audio:43761:@uIL3USK7QJg5AHohnZC329+RXS09nwjc24ulFBH2Ngg=.ed25519~FCE0J/lvL71UfApjcsyb1HO4KIljbaY5XAxK+MENq0E=\n```\n\n> **NOTE:** To avoid destroying my server, this code can only be used a limited amount of times. Please post an issue if it doesn't work for you, and I'll generate a new one.\n\nIf all goes to well, you'll start to see audio appear before your eyes! Give that play button a spin.\n\nHowever, if you don't see anything appear after about 30 seconds, try restarting ferment. It may take a minute or two before it appears. You should be all good as long as `+connected pub.ferment.audio:43761:....` appears in your terminal.\n\n**If you receive an error message, it probably means my pub server has locked up. This seems to be happening a bit at the moment, [trying to get to the bottom of it](https://github.com/mmckegg/ferment/issues/7).** Let me know and I'll restart it. In the mean time, you could start creating a shiny profile and adding some tunes!\n\n## Hosting Your Own Pub Server\n\nSee [this guide](http://ssbc.github.io/docs/scuttlebot/howto-setup-a-pub.html) for full info setting up [scuttlebot](http://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebot/).\n\n### Ferment flavoured pub server\n\nFerment includes it's own bundled server app that you can run which also functions as a tracker and torrent seeder. It also scopes the network, only replicating ferment feeds with you (rather than the normal 3-hop friend replicate, which gives you a bunch of other ssb data, which you won't be able to see but takes up hard-drive space and makes things slow for no reason).\n\nThis is all super undocumented now. Eventually there will be a one-click style install. Or at least some step by step instructions for different platforms.\n\nHere's a hint to get started:\n\n```\nxvfb-run npm run server -- --host={yourhostname} --seed {YOUR_ID}\n```\n\n## TODO\n\n- [x] Scuttlebot database\n- [x] Webtorrent streaming\n- [x] Layout main application interface, base styles\n- [x] Audio player interface\n- [x] Sequencial feed playback\n- [x] API for adding file (transcode, analyse waveform)\n- [x] Upload interface [still needs more fields, and artwork]\n- [x] Connect to local peers and merge streams\n- [x] Store artwork in blobstore, and retrieve again\n- [x] User setup (choose display name, bio, picture)\n- [x] Specific Artist Feed\n- [x] Proper play/pause/loading buttons (nice try emoji)\n- [x] Follow other users (\"friends\")\n- [x] Display following stats\n- [x] Likes\n- [x] Backgrounding (keep seeding / syncing when main window is closed)\n- [x] Invite to pub\n- [x] Make torrents more reliable via pub server trackers [still need to make this work for other pubs though, hard coded to pub.ferment.audio right now]\n- [ ] Automatically download/seed from profiles you follow\n- [ ] Make Save / Download buttons work\n- [ ] Allow \"delete\" of audio posts (some kind of tombstoning)\n- [ ] Reposting\n- [ ] Playlists\n- [ ] Show seed stats\n- [ ] Allow revisions (some kind of special reply that replaces the content with new content)\n- [ ] Figure out a way to track listens? [Would be difficult given the decentralized nature of this. Might be better to show swarm strength or some other clever metric]\n- [ ] Commenting? This is a pretty major part of soundcloud, but I'm personally not really a fan\n\n### Server\n\n- [x] Pub server (invites, etc)\n- [x] Seed torrents from specified feeds\n- [ ] Web interface for viewing specified feeds\n"
