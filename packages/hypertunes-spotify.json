  "readme": "# hypertunes-spotify\n\nA Spotify plugin for [HyperTunes](https://github.com/facekapow/hypertunes)\n\n## Requirements\n\nLibspotify must be installed:\n\n### Mac\n\nMake sure you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed, and...\n```bash\nbrew install homebrew/binary/libspotify\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify.12.1.51.dylib /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify\n```\n\n**You must also get an app key, [here](https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/), and put it in this plugin's folder**. Sorry, I\ncan't give you mine (per the Spotify Developer Terms of Service).\n\n## Installation\n\nI'll add an easy way to install plugins in HyperTunes soon, but for now:\n\nOpen a terminal (or command prompt) and go to your HyperTunes plugins folder (`/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/HyperTunes/plugins` on macOS, `C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\HyperTunes\\plugins` on Windows, `/home/USERNAME/.config/HyperTunes/plugins` or `/home/USERNAME/.HyperTunes/plugins` on Ubuntu/Linux).\nRun the following:\n\n```bash\nnpm install hypertunes-spotify\n\n# more info here: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md#using-npm\n# for Windows, replace `export` with `set`\n\n# Electron's version.\nexport npm_config_target=1.2.3\n# The architecture of Electron, can be ia32 or x64.\nexport npm_config_arch=x64\n# Download headers for Electron.\nexport npm_config_disturl=https://atom.io/download/atom-shell\n# Tell node-pre-gyp that we are building for Electron.\nexport npm_config_runtime=electron\n# Tell node-pre-gyp to build module from source code.\nexport npm_config_build_from_source=true\n# Install all dependencies, and store cache to ~/.electron-gyp.\n# I don't know what the Windows equivalent for this is, sorry.\nHOME=~/.electron-gyp npm install\n```\n\n## Note\n\nCurrently, using this plugin (selecting it in the sidebar), causes HyperTunes' memory usage to double from `200mb` to `400mb`. I believe it has to do with the Web Audio API, possibly the buffers aren't being released or something like that. Anyways, this is just a warning, but if you have plenty of memory on your PC/Mac, it shouldn't be a problem.\n"
