  "readme": "# three-png-stream\n\n[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)\n\nStreams a PNG encoded pixels from a ThreeJS `WebGLRenderTarget`. This is done in chunks of `gl.readPixels`, using [gl-pixel-stream](https://github.com/Jam3/gl-pixel-stream), and works with render targets upwards of 10000x10000 pixels in Chrome (dependent on your GPU).\n\nThe following transparent PNG image was generated with [demo.js](./demo.js), which uses [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and [hihat](https://github.com/Jam3/hihat). See [Running from Source](#running-from-source) for details.\n\n<img src=\"snowden.png\" width=\"50%\" />\n\n> *Note:* This only works on Three r69-71 and 74+.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install three-png-stream --save\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar pngStream = require('three-png-stream')\n\n// this will decide the output image size\nvar target = new THREE.WebGLRenderTarget(512, 512)\n\n// draw your scene into the target\nrenderer.render(scene, camera, target)\n\n// now you can write it to a new PNG file\nvar output = fs.createWriteStream('image.png')\npngStream(renderer, target)\n  .pipe(output)\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/three-png-stream.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-png-stream)\n\n#### `stream = pngStream(renderer, target, [opt])`\n\nCreates a new `stream` which reads pixel data from `target` in chunks, writing PNG encoded data.\n\n- `renderer` is the WebGLRenderer of ThreeJS\n- `target` is the WebGLRenderTarget; you must render to it first!\n- `opt` are some optional settings:\n  - `chunkSize` number of rows of pixels to read per chunk, default 128\n  - `flipY` whether to flip the output on the Y axis, default `true`\n  - `format` a THREE texture format to use, defaults to the format in `target`\n  - `stride` the number of channels per pixel, guessed from the format (default 4)\n\n## Running From Source\n\nClone and install:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/Jam3/three-png-stream.git\ncd three-png-stream\nnpm install\n```\n\nTo run in \"production\" mode (headless, auto-quits). This will generate `snowden.png` in the current folder.\n\n```sh\nnpm run start\n```\n\nTo run in \"development\" mode. This will open a browser with DevTools and reload on `demo.js` file save.\n\n```sh\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT, see [LICENSE.md](http://github.com/Jam3/three-png-stream/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.\n"
