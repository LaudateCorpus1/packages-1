  "readme": "biltong\n============\n\nGeometry functions used internally by jsPlumb. Perhaps useful for other people. This is not intended \nto be an exhaustive list of functions: these are things that jsPlumb needs and nothing else.  In the \ninterests of avoiding bloat in jsPlumb, it is unlikely that anything jsPlumb does not need will find \nits way into this project.\n\nBiltong can be used both in the browser and on the server, and will register itself as a CommonJS module.\n\n### Usage\n\nAll functions are in the global object `Biltong`.  I haven't got around to setting up a build to process the API docs; check the source.\n\n\n\n### Changelog\n\n#### 0.3\n\n- updated to run properly in Electron (Atom). \n"
