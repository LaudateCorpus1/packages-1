  "readme": "# electron-catalyst\n\nPackage for electron app publishing which drastically decreases bundle size by caching the prerequisites for apps to work\n\nBy using `electron-catalyst` like in the following example on a https://github.com/atom/electron-quick-start example app \n\n![](http://take.ms/F1vZo)\n\nwill generate following ![](http://take.ms/TJD3g) the `TestApp.app` is the app bundled with `Electron` but the other one `TestApp-catalyst` is bundled with https://github.com/cenkalti/catalyst which dramatically reduces the file size. Once catalysed version is launched by the end-user catalyst will get the files required in generated config above, if it's already downloaded it will re-use that which is the main trick with the catalyst.\n\nAnd if one of the catalyst bundled app is executed on the user machine before rest will re-use the existing `Electron` version.\n\nThis uses `electron-packager` for generating the traditional package which means you can use any arguments that `electron-packager` supports as well.\n\nWhole current implementation has been done in a day at Packathon http://packathon.org/ (Jan 23 '16)\n\nTODO\n----\n\n - Add linux, win platform support\n - Code cleanup\n\nAUTHORS\n-------\n \n - Gokmen Goksel (@gokmen)\n - Cenk AltÄ± (@cenkalti)\n"
